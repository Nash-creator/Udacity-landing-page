# Udacity Landing Page project
This project showcases my ability to build Navigation Bar for a dynamic landing page.
## Instructions 
The starter file had HTML and CSS styling to display a static landing page. I mainly worked on the JS fucntionality to turn the static page into an interatice one. I also modified some of the HTML and CSS to add a personal flair.
